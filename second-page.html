            	<li>There are currently 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises.</li>

	  			<li>Dolphins are marine mammals. They must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young.</li>

	  			<li>A dolphin pregnancy lasts between nine and 16 months. The mother feeds her offspring on milk. The sons and daughters of resident orcas stay with their maternal family for life.</li>

	  			<li>Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They do not chew their food but may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing.</li>

	  			<li>All dolphins have conical-shaped teeth. A Risso's dolphin has 14 while a spinner dolphin can have 240.</li>

	  			<li>The orca (killer whale) is the largest dolphin. Hector's dolphin and Franciscana are two of the smallest.</li>

	  			<li>The four river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America.</li>

	  			<li>Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills.</li>

	  			<li>Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas.</li>

	  			<li>Maui's dolphin (a sub-species of the New Zealand dolphin) is the most endangered dolphin. There are less than 50 individuals remaining. Fewer than 10 vaquitas (a species of porpoise) survive.</li>
